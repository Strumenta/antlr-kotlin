   * at this point in the ATN. You can call this anytime but ANTLR only
   * generates code to check before sub-rules/loops and each iteration.
   *
   * Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
   * sub-rules. E.g.,
   *
   * ```
   * a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
   * sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
   * ```
   *
   * At the start of a sub-rule upon error, [sync] performs single
   * token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
   * rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
   * resynchronization set of the current rule.
   *
   * If the sub-rule is optional (`(...)?`, `(...)*`, or block
   * with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
   * the sub-rule.
   *
   * During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
   * sub-rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
   * stay in the loop as long as possible.
   *
   * ### ORIGINS
   *
   * Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
   * A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
   * out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule
   *
   * ```
   * classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
   * ```
   *
   * input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
   * consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
   * member definition of the current class.
   *
   * This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
   * compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
   * some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
   * functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.

   *

   * ### EXAMPLE
   *
   * For example, input `i = (3;` is clearly missing the `')'`. When

   * call chain:
   *
   * ```
   * stat -> expr -> atom
   * ```
   *
   * and it will be trying to match the `')'` at this point in the
   * derivation:
   *
   * ```
   * => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
   *                 ^
   * ```
   *
   * The attempt to match `')'` will fail when it sees `';'` and
   * call [recoverInline]. To recover, it sees that `LA(1) == ';'`
   * is in the set of tokens that can follow the `')'` token reference
   * in rule `atom`. It can assume that you forgot the `')'`.

   *
   * This local follow set only includes tokens
   * from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
   * ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
   *
   * ### EXAMPLE
   *
   * When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
   * consistent with any of the alternatives for rule `r`. The best
   * thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
   * can legally follow a call to `r` *or* any rule that called `r`.
   * You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
   * input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
   * rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
   *
   * Consider grammar:
   *
   * ```
   * a : '[' b ']'
   *   | '(' b ')'
   *   ;
   * b : c '^' INT ;
   * c : ID
   *   | INT
   *   ;
   * ```
   *
   * At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
   * that rule is pushed on a stack. Here are the various
   * context-sensitive follow sets:
   *
   * ```
   * FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
   * FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
   * FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
   * ```
   *
   * Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
   *
   * ```
   * a -> b -> c
   * ```
   *
   * and, hence, the follow context stack is:
   *
   * ```
   * depth     follow set       start of rule execution
   *   0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
   *   1          ']'                     b
   *   2          '^'                     c
   * ```
   *
   * Notice that `')'` is not included, because `b` would have to have
   * been called from a different context in rule `a` for `')'` to be
   * included.
   *
   * For error recovery, we cannot consider `FOLLOW(c)`
   * (context-sensitive or otherwise). We need the combined set of
   * all context-sensitive `FOLLOW` sets--the set of all tokens that
   * could follow any reference in the call chain. We need to
   * resync to one of those tokens. Note that `FOLLOW(c)='^'` and if
   * we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until `EOF`. We need to
   * sync to context-sensitive `FOLLOW`s for `a`, `b`, and `c`: `{']','^'}`.
   * In this case, for input "[]", `LA(1)` is `']'` and in the set, so we would
   * not consume anything. After printing an error, rule `c` would
   * return normally. Rule `b` would not find the required `'^'` though.
   * At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
   * exception (since `LA(1)` is not in the viable following token set).
   * The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
   * the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.
   * Rule `b` exits normally returning to rule `a`.
   * Now it finds the `']'` (and with the successful match exits [errorRecoveryMode]).
   *
   * So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
   * for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
   *
   * Errors are not generated in [errorRecoveryMode].
   *
   * ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
   *
   * Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, by Niklaus Wirth
   *
   * and:
   *
   * [A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905)
   *
   * Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
   *
   * [Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent Parsers](ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip)
   *
   * Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
   * at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
