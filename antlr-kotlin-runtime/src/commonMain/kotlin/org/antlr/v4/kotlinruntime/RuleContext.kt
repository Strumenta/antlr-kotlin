/**
 * A rule context is a record of a single rule invocation.
 *
 * We form a stack of these context objects using the parent
 * pointer. A parent pointer of `null` indicates that the current
 * context is the bottom of the stack. The ParserRuleContext subclass
 * as a children list so that we can turn this data structure into a
 * tree.
 *
 * The root node always has a `null` pointer and [invokingState] of `-1`.
 *
 * Upon entry to parsing, the first invoked rule function creates a
 * context object (a subclass specialized for that rule such as
 * `SContext`) and makes it the root of a parse tree, recorded by field
 * `Parser.context`.
 *
 * ```
 * @Throws(RecognitionException::class)
 * public fun s(): SContext {
 *   val _localctx = SContext(context, state)  // create new node
 *   enterRule(_localctx, 0, RULE_s)           // push it
 *   ...
 *   exitRule()                                // pop back to _localctx
 *   return _localctx
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A subsequent rule invocation of `r` from the start rule `s` pushes a
 * new context object for `r` whose parent points at `s` and use invoking
 * state is the state with `r` emanating as edge label.
 *
 * The [invokingState] fields from a context object to the root
 * together form a stack of rule indication states where the root
 * (bottom of the stack) has a `-1` sentinel value. If we invoke start
 * symbol `s` then call `r1`, which calls `r2`, they would look like this:
 *
 * ```
 * SContext[-1]   <- root node (bottom of the stack)
 * R1Context[p]   <- p in rule s called r1
 * R2Context[q]   <- q in rule r1 called r2
 * ```
 *
 * So the top of the stack, `context`, represents a call to the current
 * rule, and it holds the return address from another rule that invoke
 * to this rule. To invoke a rule, we must always have a current context.
 *
 * The parent contexts are useful for computing lookahead sets and
 * getting error information.
 *
 * These objects are used during parsing and prediction.
 * For the special case of parsers, we use the subclass [ParserRuleContext].
