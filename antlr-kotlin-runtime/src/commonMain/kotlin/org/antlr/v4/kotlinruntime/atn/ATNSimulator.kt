   * The context cache maps all [PredictionContext] objects that are `equals()`
   * to a single cached copy. This cache is shared across all contexts
   * in all [ATNConfig]s in all [DFA] states. We rebuild each [ATNConfigSet]
   * to use only cached nodes/graphs in `addDFAState()`. We don't want to
   * fill this during `closure()` since there are lots of contexts that
   * pop up but are not used ever again. It also greatly slows down `closure()`.
   *
   * This cache makes a huge difference in memory and a little bit in speed.
   * For the Java grammar on java.*, it dropped the memory requirements
   * at the end from 25M to 16M. We don't store any of the full context
   * graphs in the DFA because they are limited to local context only,
   * but apparently there's a lot of repetition there as well. We optimize
   * the config contexts before storing the config set in the DFA states
   * by literally rebuilding them with cached sub-graphs only.
   *
   * I tried a cache for use during closure operations, that was
   * whacked after each `adaptivePredict()`. It cost a little bit
   * more time I think and doesn't save on the overall footprint,
   * so it's not worth the complexity.
