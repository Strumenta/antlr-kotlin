     * Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.
     *
     * This method computes the SLL prediction termination condition for both of
     * the following cases.
     *
     * - The usual SLL+LL fallback upon SLL conflict
     * - Pure SLL without LL fallback
     *
     * ### COMBINED SLL+LL PARSING
     *
     * When LL-fallback is enabled upon SLL conflict, correct predictions are
     * ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this
     * method. Due to the substantially higher cost of LL prediction, the
     * prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
     * cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.
     *
     * Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
     * conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
     * configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.
     * `{1,2}` and `{3,4}`). If there is at least one non-conflicting
     * configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
     * resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.
     *
     * Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
     * stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
     * full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.
     *
     * ### HEURISTIC
     *
     * As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
     * unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
     * The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
     * (otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):
     *
     * ```
     * [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;
     * ```
     *
     * When the ATN simulation reaches the state before `';'`, it has a
     * DFA state that looks like: `[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]`. Naturally
     * `12|1|[]` and `12|2|[]` conflict, but we cannot stop
     * processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
     * via `[6|2|[]]`.
     *
     * It also lets us continue for this rule:
     *
     * ```
     * [1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;
     * ```
     *
     * After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
     * State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
     * conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
     * However, alternative 3 will be able to continue, and so we do not stop
     * working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
     * states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
     * associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
     * looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.
     *
     * ### PURE SLL PARSING
     *
     * To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
     * combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
     * predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.
     *
     * ### PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING
     *
     * SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
     * states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
     * semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
     * during start state computation, so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
     * This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
     * predicates.
     *
     * Implementation-wise, [ATNConfigSet] combines stack contexts but not
     * semantic predicate contexts, so we might see two configurations like the
     * following.
     *
     * ```
     * (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p})
     * ```
     *
     * Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
     * `x` and `x'` (without modifying the existing configurations).
     * For example, we test `(x+x')==x''` when looking for conflicts in
     * the following configurations.
     *
     * ```
     * (s, 1, x, {}), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})
     * ```
     *
     * If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
     * [ATNConfigSet.hasSemanticContext]), this algorithm makes a copy of
     * the configurations to strip out all the predicates so that a standard
     * [ATNConfigSet] will merge everything ignoring predicates.

    /**
     * Full LL prediction termination.
     *
     * Can we stop looking ahead during ATN simulation or is there some
     * uncertainty as to which alternative we will ultimately pick, after
     * consuming more input? Even if there are partial conflicts, we might know
     * that everything is going to resolve to the same minimum alternative. That
     * means we can stop since no more lookahead will change that fact. On the
     * other hand, there might be multiple conflicts that resolve to different
     * minimums. That means we need more look ahead to decide which of those
     * alternatives we should predict.
     *
     * The basic idea is to split the set of configurations `C`, into
     * conflicting subsets `(s, _, ctx, _)` and singleton subsets with
     * non-conflicting configurations. Two configurations conflict if they have
     * identical [ATNConfig.state] and [ATNConfig.context] values
     * but different [ATNConfig.alt] value, e.g., `(s, i, ctx, _)`
     * and `(s, j, ctx, _)` for `i!=j`.
     *
     * Reduce these configuration subsets to the set of possible alternatives.
     * You can compute the alternative subsets in one pass as follows:
     *
     * `A_s,ctx = {i | (s, i, ctx, _)}` for each configuration in
     * `C` holding `s` and `ctx` fixed.
     *
     * Or in pseudocode, for each configuration `c` in `C`:
     *
     * ```
     * map[c] U= c.alt # map hash/equals uses s and x, not alt and not pred
     * ```
     *
     * The values in [map] are the set of `A_s,ctx` sets.
     *
     * If `|A_s,ctx|=1` then there is no conflict associated with `s` and `ctx`.
     *
     * Reduce the subsets to singletons by choosing a minimum of each subset. If
     * the union of these alternative subsets is a singleton, then no amount of
     * more lookahead will help us. We will always pick that alternative. If,
     * however, there is more than one alternative, then we are uncertain which
     * alternative to predict and must continue looking for resolution. We may
     * or may not discover an ambiguity in the future, even if there are no
     * conflicting subsets this round.
     *
     * The biggest sin is to terminate early because it means we've made a
     * decision but were uncertain as to the eventual outcome. We haven't used
     * enough lookahead. On the other hand, announcing a conflict too late is no
     * big deal; you will still have the conflict. It's just inefficient. It
     * might even look until the end of file.
     *
     * No special consideration for semantic predicates is required because
     * predicates are evaluated on-the-fly for full LL prediction, ensuring that
     * no configuration contains a semantic context during the termination
     * check.
     *
     * ### CONFLICTING CONFIGS
     *
     * Two configurations `(s, i, x)` and `(s, j, x')`, conflict
     * when `i!=j` but `x=x'`. Because we merge all
     * `(s, i, _)` configurations together, that means that there are at
     * most `n` configurations associated with state `s` for
     * `n` possible alternatives in the decision. The merged stacks
     * complicate the comparison of configuration contexts `x` and
     * `x'`. Sam checks to see if one is a subset of the other by calling
     * merge and checking to see if the merged result is either `x` or
     * `x'`. If the `x` associated with the lowest alternative `i`
     * is the superset, then `i` is the only possible prediction since the
     * others resolve to `min(i)` as well. However, if `x` is
     * associated with `j>i` then at least one stack configuration for
     * `j` is not in conflict with alternative `i`. The algorithm
     * should keep going, looking for more lookahead due to the uncertainty.
     *
     * For simplicity, I'm doing an equality check between `x` and
     * `x'` that lets the algorithm continue to consume lookahead longer
     * than necessary. The reason I like the equality is of course the
     * simplicity but also because that is the test you need to detect the
     * alternatives that are actually in conflict.
     *
     * ### CONTINUE/STOP RULE
     *
     * Continue if union of resolved alternative sets from non-conflicting and
     * conflicting alternative subsets has more than one alternative. We are
     * uncertain about which alternative to predict.
     *
     * The complete set of alternatives, `[i for (_,i,_)]`, tells us which
     * alternatives are still in the running for the amount of input we've
     * consumed at this point. The conflicting sets let us strip away
     * configurations that won't lead to more states because we resolve
     * conflicts to the configuration with a minimum alternate for the
     * conflicting set.
     *
     * ### CASES
     *
     * - no conflicts and more than 1 alternative in set => continue
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s, 3, z)`,
     *   `(s', 1, y)`, `(s', 2, y)` yields non-conflicting set
     *   `{3}` U conflicting sets `min({1,2})` U `min({1,2})` =
     *   `{1,3}` => continue
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s', 1, y)`,
     *   `(s', 2, y)`, `(s'', 1, z)` yields non-conflicting set
     *   `{1}` U conflicting sets `min({1,2})` U `min({1,2})` =
     *   `{1}` => stop and predict 1
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s', 1, y)`,
     *   `(s', 2, y)` yields conflicting, reduced sets `{1}` U
     *   `{1}` = `{1}` =&gt; stop and predict 1, can announce
     *   ambiguity `{1,2}`
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s', 2, y)`,
     *   `(s', 3, y)` yields conflicting, reduced sets `{1}` U
     *   `{2}` = `{1,2}` => continue
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s', 3, y)`,
     *   `(s', 4, y)` yields conflicting, reduced sets `{1}` U
     *   `{3}` = `{1,3}` => continue
     *
     * ### EXACT AMBIGUITY DETECTION
     *
     * If all states report the same conflicting set of alternatives, then we
     * know we have the exact ambiguity set.
     *
     * `|A_i|>1` and `A_i = A_j` for all i, j.
     *
     * In other words, we continue examining lookahead until all `A_i`
     * have more than one alternative and all `A_i` are the same. If
     * `A={{1,2}, {1,3}}`, then regular LL prediction would terminate
     * because the resolved set is `{1}`. To determine what the real
     * ambiguity is, we have to know whether the ambiguity is between one and
     * two or one and three, so we keep going. We can only stop prediction when
     * we need exact ambiguity detection when the sets look like
     * `A={{1,2}}` or `{{1,2},{1,2}}`, etc...
